**[`Latentspace-explorer`](https://github.com/Parici75/latentspace-explorer)** is a toolbox based on [Dash](https://plotly.com/dash/) that let you easily dive into multivariate data.

The library was designed as a user-friendly tool for carrying out interactive exploratory data analysis of multidimensional dataset.

Data exploration in Jupyter notebooks can be tedious and lead to a pile of endless variations of statistical visualization plots.

latentspace-explorer combines dimensionality reduction, probability density estimation, and clustering techniques to enable deep exploration of multivariate datasets across different facets.
